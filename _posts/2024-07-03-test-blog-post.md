Neural networks are the backbone of many modern AI systems, powering everything from image recognition to natural language processing. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of neural networks and how they're revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence.

## What is a Neural Network?

At its core, a neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers:

1. Input Layer
2. Hidden Layer(s)
3. Output Layer

Each connection between neurons has a weight, which is adjusted during the learning process.

## How Neural Networks Learn

Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation. Here's a simplified version of how it works:

1. Forward pass: Input data is fed through the network
2. Calculate error: Compare the output to the expected result
3. Backward pass: Adjust weights to minimize error

Here's a simple Python implementation of a neuron:

```python
def simple_neuron(input, weight):
    return input * weight

# Example usage
input_value = 0.5
weight = 0.8
output = simple_neuron(input_value, weight)
print(f"Neuron output: {output}")
```
