        <p>Whoami? Tl;dr: My name is Nicholi Caron and I'm an enterprising 20-something – searching for myself, a righteous cause, and a job I'll love. Both a <strong>child of the millennium</strong>, and a <strong>friend of the electron.</strong></p>

        <p>I'm a mostly self-taught guy who wants to work on cool technologies. I'm driven by the prospect of architecting the digital infrastructure of the future. I believe that AI has brought us to the highest leverage point in history; today, one person can do what it would have taken dozens to just decades ago. Steve Jobs once said that the personal computer is a bicycle for the mind. A modern continuation of that metaphor would be that AI is performance enhancing drugs. <strong>Even the average Joe can become Lance Armstrong.</strong></p>

        <p>I intend to use this site as a public notepad – documenting the projects I work on, the books I read, and the musings I have along life's journey. One of the most important skills to have as an engineer is the ability to write – effective communication is just as important as the ideas that one communicates. Additionally, I think teaching others is the best way to teach yourself. So let's buckle in and get this show on the road.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="poem">
If you're going to try, go all the way.
Otherwise, don't even start.
If you're going to try, go all the way. 
This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe even your mind.
It could mean not eating for three or four days. 
It could mean freezing on a park bench.
It could mean jail. 
It could mean derision, mockery, isolation.
Isolation is the gift.
All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. 
And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.
And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.
If you're going to try, go all the way. 
There is no other feeling like that.
You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.
DO IT. DO IT. DO IT. All the way
You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. 
It's the only good fight there is.
